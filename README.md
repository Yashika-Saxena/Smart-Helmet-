A smart helmet is a special idea which makes motorcycle driving safer than before. This is implemented using ESP32. 
The working of this smart helmet using ESP32 is very simple, we place vibration sensor, alcohol sensor and helmet lock sensor in different places of helmet where the probability of hitting is more which are connected to ESP32 board. 
So, when the rider crashes and the helmet hit the ground, the sensors sense and the ESP32 extract GPS data using the GPS module that is interfaced with ESP32. 
When the data exceeds minimum stress limit then RF module automatically sends message to ambulance or police or family members.
** Platforms to be used:**
**Hardware:** ESP32 board, RF module, vibration sensor, alcohol sensor, magnetic
lock sensor, LCD16X2 display, GPS module, Encoder-decoder IC.
**Software:** ESP32 ID
